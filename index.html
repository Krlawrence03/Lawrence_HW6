      <h2>ABOUT KYLE</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a senior at the <strong>University of Iowa</strong> majoring in <strong>Business Analytics and Information Systems</strong>.
        Originally from <strong>Eagan, Minnesota</strong>, I graduated from Eagan High School before coming to Iowa City.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently serve as the <strong>Interfraternity Council President</strong> and am a proud member of <strong>Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji)</strong>.
        My experiences in leadership and student engagement have shaped my passion for bringing people together and driving data-informed decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I’m passionate about <strong>data analysis and visualization</strong>. During my internship at <strong>Donaldson Company, Inc.</strong>,
        I worked in <strong>Revenue Operations</strong> on a variety of data visualization and data management projects that supported the Mobile Solutions Sales division.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics and work, I’m constantly looking for ways to apply data to real-world business challenges and strengthen my technical skills
        in analytics tools such as Power BI and SQL.
